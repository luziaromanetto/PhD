# PhD

### TODO list:
> - read the paper *Optimization and label propagation in bipartite heterogeneous networks to improve transductive classification of texts*
> - read the paper *Optimizing the class information divergence for transductive classification of texts using propagation in bipartite graphs*
> - read the unpublished paper
> - read about and organize the benchmarking text collections ( see the paper from Rossi )
> - talk with Alneu about the project.

## week 07/08 to 11/08
> - read the paper *A Parameter-Free Label Propagation Algorithm Using Bipartite Heterogeneous Networks for Text Classification*
> > In this paper is propose a transductive method that model documents and terms as a bipartet graph, and build a matrix of wheights from that. With the wheight matrix they build a new stocastic matrix based, with this matrix the run a fixed-point method and shows that this method perform in many cases perform better than others stat of art methods.

> > **Notes :** 
> > - I think the proof of convergence is missing a few steps.
> > - I think the comparison with SVM did not use the right parameters, but that would be a further work in producing the article.

## week 31/07 to 04/08
> - worked in the WVIS paper
> - read first chapter of text mining book
> - read part of Thiago Theses
> - requared inscription in network minning
